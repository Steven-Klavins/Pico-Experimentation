# LED Blink

Perhaps one of the simplest projects you can build for the Pico is the LED Blink project. This small snippet of code enables the board to intermittently flash the onboard LED on and off.

## In order to complete this project, you will need the following: 
1 x Raspberry Pi Pico
1 x Micro USB cable

### Before running please follow the [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/) on how to install MicroPython to your device. 

## How to run
**1.** Hold the Pico's onboard power button and connect it to your computer via a micro USB cable, your device should show up as removable storage. 

**2.** Download the <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Steven-Klavins/Pico-Experimentation/main/LED%20Blink/main.py">code</a> and copy it to your device (ensure the file name remains 'main.py' as it will fail to run in the event its name something else)

**3.** Tap the power button on your Pico board to soft reboot and you're done! The onboard LED will now continuously flash on and off every 0.5 seconds.
